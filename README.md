## Introduction

This repository is designed for students and developers who want to deepen their understanding of advanced Python topics. It includes practical examples, detailed explanations, and hands-on exercises to help you master threading, socket programming, and design patterns.

## Threading

### Overview

Threading allows you to run multiple operations concurrently in the same process space. This section covers the basics of threading in Python, including creating and managing threads, synchronization, and thread communication.

### Examples

- **Basic Threading**: Simple example of creating and running threads.
- **Thread Synchronization**: Using Locks, Semaphores, and Conditions.
- **Thread Communication**: Example using Queue for thread-safe communication.

### Exercises

- Implement a multi-threaded program to download multiple files concurrently.
- Create a thread-safe counter using locks.
- Build a producer-consumer model using threading and queues.

## Socket Programming

### Overview

Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. This section covers the basics of socket programming in Python, including TCP/UDP protocols, client-server architecture, and data transmission.

### Examples

- **TCP Server and Client**: Simple implementation of a TCP server and client.
- **UDP Communication**: Example of UDP server and client.
- **Chat Application**: Building a simple chat application using sockets.

### Exercises

- Create a multi-threaded TCP server that can handle multiple clients simultaneously.
- Implement a simple file transfer protocol using sockets.
- Build a broadcast messaging system using UDP.

## Design Patterns

### Overview

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. This section covers several design patterns in Python, including Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy patterns.

### Examples

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensure a class has only one instance.
- **Factory Pattern**: Create objects without specifying the exact class.
- **Observer Pattern**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable.

### Exercises

- Implement a logging class using the Singleton pattern.
- Create a shape factory that can produce different shapes.
- Build a notification system using the Observer pattern.
- Develop a context-based calculator using the Strategy pattern.
